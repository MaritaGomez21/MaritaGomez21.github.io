# The Situation
A real use case for automations is to automatically create a task for the lead owner to follow up with the new lead based on the product interest or when the lead was updated based on a product change. This business request can be solved with either a record trigger flow or Apex. To understand the approach of using Apex vs Flows I did both but in 2 seperate developer orgs.

## The Approach

### The LeadTrigger, LeadTriggerHandler, UtilityClass, and LeadTriggerHandler Test
[add details here]

### The Record Trigger Flow included the following features:
* A simple formula to set up the entry criteria for the flow when a Lead Record is Created or Updated.
* A decision element to determine if the Product Interest was changed (a simple way to segregate new records
vs updated lead records).
* If the lead record is new, [ustomize the verbage]
* If the lead record was updated and the product interest was changed, then [use this verbage]
