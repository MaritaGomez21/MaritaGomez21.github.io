# ARTICLE UNDER CONSTRUCTION
With anything Salesforce there are multiple ways to provide a solution, the key is to provide a solution that is best for the user, business, and within generally accepted best practices. The solution is not always Apex nor always Flows or even automation.

## The Situation
In a hypothetical case the a sales manager would like a task assigned to the lead owner to follow up with the lead based on selected product interest. If the product interest is changed for an existing lead then assign a task to the lead owner. 

## The Approach
In Salesforce, the following are two examples of how to solution this business request:
1. An After Save Record Trigger Flow
2. Apex Trigger, Handler, Utility Class, and Test
To understand these 2 solutions of going either route (programmatic vs flows) I set up both utilizing separate developer orgs.

### The Record Trigger Flow:
Simple After Save Record Trigger Flow can be set up as follows:

![LeadFlow](/assets/images/Lead Flow.jpg)

* A simple formula to set up the entry criteria for the flow when a Lead Record is Created or Updated.

* A decision element to determine if the lead record is new or if the product interest was changed (meaning the lead record was updated).

* If the lead record was updated and the product interest was changed, then create a task with the subject as indicated in the following Text Template.

* If the lead record was new, then create a task with the subject line as indicated in the following Text Template.

* You can optionally set the Due Date dynamically (depends on business requirement) for the Task using the following formula resource.

* Just in case there is ever an error, add error handling in the flow with a Fault Path and Custom Error. Creates a better user experience instead of seeing an Unhandled fault error.

### The Apex Trigger and Classes
To keep in line with best practices, I set up a Lead Trigger to redirect records to their destined path of automation, Lead Trigger Handler to hold all the business logic, a Utility class to avoid having repetitive code ("DRY" aka don't repeat yourself!), and a Lead Trigger Handler Test class to not only meet Salesforce's minimum code coverage for deployments but to also make sure the code is working properly.
