# Background
To gain some hands on experience with Salesforce Experience Sites I created a Personal portfolio. It provides a quick "at-a-glance summary".

# Approach
* "Under the hood" is a Salesforce Experience Site Aura Customer Account Portal template with the Ember theme. 
* To add depth to the site, I created additional pages (About Me, Experience, Certifications, Education, and Feedback Form).
* Using HTML to include a favicon and navigational icons to automatically navigate to my personal LinkedIn profile and Trailhead profile when the Guest clicks on the respective footer icon.
* Provide Guests a feedback form. Using a screen flow the Guest can provide the necessary information to create a "lead" record for me. Once the user submits feedback, the screen auto-navigates to the confirmation screen within the site and sends me an email directly with the information the guest provided.

# Results
Having this hands on experience with this site and multiple builds of experience sites using Trailhead, I now have the Salesforce Experience Cloud Consultant Certification.

Here is the link to the site, feel free to fill out the feedback form.

# Next Steps
* Utilize a lightning web component to showcase additional features of Salesforce Experience Sites.
